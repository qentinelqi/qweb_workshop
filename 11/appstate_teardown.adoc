= Appstates & Teardowns

Qentinel Pace supports *Appstate* definition to handle making sure application is in correct state before actual testing starts. *Suite Setup* and *Suite Teardown* handle actions that are needed to be done before suite execution starts or after the execution ends.

== Appstate

*Appstate* is usually the first keyword in every test case. It should handle all preconditions for a test case, i.e. make sure that when the actual testing starts, we know exactly what is the state of the application.

As an example, if you are testing _shopping cart_ functionality in a web application and need to validate that the amount of items in a cart match to expected value, then you should make sure in your appstate that shopping cart is in know state (usually no items in shopping cart) prior to executing rest of the test case. 

Due to nature of differences in applications Appstates are usually keywords that test automator has to define by himself/herself. Custom keywords are defined in *resources* file.  Here is one example of the Appstate structure:

In resource file (for example _./resources/keywords.robot_) create a custom keyword for Appstate implementation:

Then, in your test cases you could make sure correct language specific pages are open by calling the Appstate:

Usually Appstates are used for example to login to application on web or making sure certain dialog or view is open on native/mobile applications.

NOTE: More about Appstates in xref:pacewords-reference::index_pacewords.adoc[PaceWords reference]

== Suite/Test Setup and Teardown

Use *Suite Setup/Teardown* to handle conditions that will be done once per test suite. 
For example:

* opening/closing browser
* loading test data etc.

Use *Test Setup/Teardown* to handle conditions that will be done once per test case, for example logout or loading test data specifically for one test case.

The keyword implementation for the above suite setup/teardown and test setup would probably look something like this (would defined in _.\resources\keywords.robot_):

## Exercise

As an execise we will create a script which will fill in the contacts page in https://qentinelqi.github.io/shop/ according to information given in this screenshot:

image::../images/scripting_setup_teardown.png[]

{empty} +
{empty} +
{empty} +
{empty} +
{empty} +
{empty} +
{empty} +
{empty} +

. Opening browser is done on *Suite Setup*
. Closing broser is done on *Suite Teardown*
. Navigating to contacts page is done on *Appstate    Contact*
